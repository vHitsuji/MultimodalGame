# Tracked agents - specific pairs are listed in '*_eval_agent_list.pkl' and need to be manually entered. The file is generated automatically when any community is trained. The list is also printed in the log file at the beginning of training.
# Key
# self_com - agents evaluated playing against themselves
# pool_com - agents are from the same original pool (same inital linguistic group)
# xpool_com - agents are from different original pools (different inital linguistic groups)
# 1pplus - agent is trained with agents from within its original group and with agents from other groups
# 1p - agent is only trained with agents from its original group
# tt - trained together
# ntt - not trained together
# frozen - agent playing with a frozen version of itself. Frozen before multi-community training was commenced.
