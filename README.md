## Training data

This model used ShapeWorld datasets. All the datasets used in this project are available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1p0GtLX_Y_w78zWoc9Qe8jFPniLOtkr1E?usp=sharing).

- **oneshape**: training dataset, 5k examples
- **oneshape_valid**: in domain evaluation dataset, same distribution as training set, 1k examples
- **oneshape_valid_large**: larger in domain evaluation dataset, same distribution as training set, 5k examples
- **oneshape_valid_all_combos**: out of domain evaluation dataset, contains all of the combinations in the training dataset + 6 held out shape-color combinations. All shapes and colors are contained in the training data, but 6 shape-color combinations are new. 5k examples

See example training and evaluation scripts below for more details of how to use these datasets.

### Building the datasets

To generate an example dataset run the following command. This generates 5000 examples and is equivalent to the training dataset "oneshape" used for this project, available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1p0GtLX_Y_w78zWoc9Qe8jFPniLOtkr1E?usp=sharing).

```
mkdir data
cd ShapeWorld
./build_datasets.sh
cd ..
```

The models also depend on pre-trained word embeddings. We recommend using the `6B.100d` GloVe embeddings available [here](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/).

### About ShapeWorld

ShapeWorld is a framework which allows to specify generators for abstract, visually grounded language data (or just visual data).

It was written by *Alexander Kuhnle and Ann Copestake* (April 2017) and adapted by *Laura Graesser* for this project.

## Training agents

Agents can be trained in three configurations.
1. One pair of two agents - the most simple case
2. Pools of n agents - fully connected graph structure
3. Communities of n pools of k agents - sparse graph structure, user defined connectivity. Two sub types
  - Dense: Agents in each pool are connected to agents in every other pool with probability p
  - Chain: Agents in each pool are connected only to agents in neighboring pools with probability p.
    - e.g. 5 pools, with indices 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Agents in pool 1 are connected only to agents in pool 2, where as agents in pool 2 are connected to agents in pool 1 and 3.


Note: these examples assume that you have downloaded the data from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1p0GtLX_Y_w78zWoc9Qe8jFPniLOtkr1E?usp=sharing) and have organized it using the following file structure.

## Analyzing log files

These files extract different types of tracked data from either the training or eval log files. See the comments in the bash scripts for usage and more details.

- `./logs/analyze_xproduct.sh`: outputs a 2d table of the in domain accuracy for all pairs of agents
- `./logs/analyze_communities.sh`: outputs a table containing the in domain accuracy for all tracked pairs of agents for a community containing 2 pools.
- `./logs/analyze_communities_chain_3.sh`: outputs a table containing the in domain accuracy for all tracked pairs of agents for a chain community containing 3 pools.
- `./logs/analyze_communities_chain_4.sh`: outputs a table containing the in domain accuracy for all tracked pairs of agents for a chain community containing 4 pools.
